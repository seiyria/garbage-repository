# garbage-repository
A garbage repository.

Basically, GitHub doesn't store events for your GitHub streak, it calculates it every time. If someone deletes a repo, boom, you have patches in your history. This repository is here to patch those holes. To keep everything honest, I'll be fixing my streak from when my [blog post was written](http://seiyria.com/javascript,/github,/life/2015/06/05/365-days-of-github.html), so... June 25th, 2014.
